	 * Script
	 *
	 * The script consists of commands separated by one or more
	 * spaces. Each command consists of one or more operations,
	 * which are stored one after the other without spaces.
	 * The operation is represented by a single character of the
	 * alphabet. Operation can have one numeric argument, which
	 * must be written immediately after the operation character.
	 *
	 * Operations:
	 *
	 * - `f[hz]`:
	 *   Set frequency from optional argument. If no argument
	 *   is specified, the current default frequency will be used.
	 *
	 * - `F[hz]`:
	 *   Same as `f[hz]`, but if an argument is specified, the
	 *   value will then be used as the default frequency for
	 *   subsequent commands.
	 *
	 * - `d[ms]`:
	 *   Set duration from optional argument. If no argument
	 *   is specified, the current default duration will be used.
	 *
	 * - `D[ms]`:
	 *   Same as `d[ms]`, but if an argument is specified, the
	 *   value will then be used as the default duration for
	 *   subsequent commands.
	 *
	 * - `k`:
	 *   Keep the PWM enabled when the command is completed.
	 *
	 * If no `f` or `F` operation is specified in a command, then
	 * a frequency of 0 will be used for that command, i.e. such
	 * commands can be used to delay script execution.
	 *
	 * If no `d` or `D` operation is specified in a command, the
	 * current default duration will be used for that command.
	 * Changing the default duration can either be done through
	 * the configuration structure or directly at runtime with
	 * the `D[ms]` operation.
	 *
	 * Examples:
	 *
	 * Script for three short beeps with a frequency of 1000 Hz
	 * (duration 100 ms with 50 ms delay between):
	 * <code>
	 *     F1000D100 d50 f d50 f
